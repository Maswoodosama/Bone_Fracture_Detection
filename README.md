This project aims to detect bone fractures in X-ray images using the YOLOv8 object detection model from Ultralytics,

Bone fracture detection is critical task in medical imaging, This project leverages the Yolov8 mode for object detection to identify fractures in X-ray images accurately and efficiently

# OVERVIEW

Bone Fracture diagnosis is a crucial yet time-consuming task in medical imaging, Manual detection is subject to human error and variablity, By leverging deep learning and YOLOv8, we can develop a model that detects fractures 
in real-time with impressive precision 

# DATASET

The dataset contains X-ray images of bones, annotated with bounding boxes around fracture areas in YOLO format
